  <div class="post-content"><p>6 hours ago, I wrote my final exam of my 2A term.</p>
<p>The 2A term has always felt like the Department of ECE decided to limit test its students. Engineering, and ECE in general, has always been a meme for having some of the worst schedules that a person could devise (see the 1B schedule below), but there was just something about the 2A structure that was so uniquely soul crushing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/2A/1B.jpeg" alt="me"  />

<em>The big green wall.</em></p>
<p>For as bad as that schedule <em>looks</em>, in actuality it isn&rsquo;t terrible, because this is still first year. The only real concern is having to be conscious enough in the morning to go do your labs.</p>
<p>In 2A, the schedule <em>looks</em> a lot nicer. But you still have 6 courses, five of which are full credit, and 3 of which have labs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece109">ECE109</a>: Materials Chemistry</li>
<li><a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece204">ECE204</a>: Numerical Methods</li>
<li><a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece205">ECE205</a>: Advanced Calculus 1 (Differential Equations)</li>
<li><a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece222">ECE222</a>: Digital Computers</li>
<li><a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece240">ECE240</a>: Electronic Circuits</li>
<li><a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece250">ECE250</a>: Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</li>
</ul>
<p>How&rsquo;d it go? Well&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="september">September<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september">#</a></h2>
<p>2A started rather unceremoniously. At the end of my previous term, I arranged a research assistantship with a friend of mine, which would&rsquo;ve been about developing a Verilog synthesizer in Scala. But as 1B came to a close, I fell quite short of the requirements for the URA and fell out of eligibility. This was entirely my fault; the sum of a lot of preventable mistakes, but it was a very sour note to begin the term on.</p>
<p>As school started, so did the co-op search. I was looking to get into embedded software and systems programming this time around. My first co-op was as a systems engineer where I developed internal tools for the company&rsquo;s R&amp;D sector. When I was searching for my first co-op, I interviewed for two firmware positions and got an offer for one of them, but for certain reasons decided not to accept it.</p>
<p>September came and went; the first co-op cycle was relatively uneventful aside from a very weird interview where my interviewer left the call for 10 out of 30 minutes. School was beginning to speed up and I was&hellip; very neglectful of it.</p>
<h2 id="october">October<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#october">#</a></h2>
<p>October is when the gravity of my procrastination really started to weigh on me. To begin, I couldn&rsquo;t convert that interview into an offer (although I&rsquo;m still not sure how much that&rsquo;s my fault), putting me in cycle 2. The month was characterized by a cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a task ahead.</li>
<li>Feel confident about finishing it in a short time.</li>
<li>Start the task, overrun my estimated time by 2x on the simplest part.</li>
<li>Start tweaking until something clicks.</li>
</ol>
<p>On a serious note, it was during one of my 250 projects when I felt that something was off with me. It was the combination of a bunch of factors weighing on me all at once.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d be able to get an early co-op and not have to go through the hell that is job searching during hell week. I thought I&rsquo;d be able to do a lot better with school than I did last term. I thought that I would be doing interesting research. I thought I would be a better person than I was last term.</p>
<p>But to all of these, I was wrong. I felt, ultimately that I had let a lot of people down; primarily myself.</p>
<p>Outside of academic life there was even more weighing down. Over my co-op term I was diagnosed with a chronic, possibly autoimmune skin disease that I had been dealing with for a year at that point. It&rsquo;s characterized by inflammed, scaly and flaky skin almost like psoriasis. At the point where I was during October, I felt like trying to treat it was futile. The pain resulting from it only increased day by day, but I had exhausted all treatment options by that point. I didn&rsquo;t like being dependent on medication even if they weren&rsquo;t addictive; it just felt like false hope to me since I knew that it would come back. Between my family doctor, dermatologist, and any sources I could get my hands on that were the slightest bit helpful, one statement was repeated by all of them: &ldquo;this is lifelong.&rdquo; It just seemed so bizzare that one day a switch flipped and suddenly my skin is trying to kill itself. I started to wonder if at this point, everything was beyond repair. So I stopped everything. Anything that had even an ounce of medication in it, I wouldn&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>All of these combined into a period of severe depression, as I was entering the most stressful time of the semester. Studying for my five back-to-back midterms was, to say the least, difficult. My primary concern was ECE240; like all my classes at that point, I was not very caught up and trying desperately to do so before the midterm. Historically, 240 had some awful exams; so difficult you wonder who was meant to solve them. But this was a new professor and I had no idea if that was still the case. So, I blindly invested most of my time into this exam, as I felt reasonably better about my other courses.</p>
<p>Exam week rolls around. I&rsquo;ll give you the day-by-day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday (240): Class consensus is that it was extremely easy (to be fair it was just like the homework we practiced with). In hindsight, it was definitely a really easy exam, but in the moment I felt like I got a 20. I spent the rest of the day trying to block it out of my mind and study for my next midterm. When I got home I had a breakdown over the exam.</li>
<li>Tuesday (222): VERY long but I felt way better about how I did. Spent the majority of that day studying for my <strong>next</strong> midterm since 222 was at night.</li>
<li>Wednesday (204): Pretty standard but I could&rsquo;ve studied more.</li>
<li>Thursday (250): I did a lot of prep and I felt prepared for the entire exam, save this one design question. Felt like this was going to be my best midterm.</li>
<li>Friday (205): This was my birthday (October 25). I felt like it went similar to 204; fine but I should&rsquo;ve studied more. In the afternoon I went rock climbing with some friends and got back our 204 grade in the middle of that. My result? 45. I was a little adamant that there had to be a mistake, but felt deep down that there wasn&rsquo;t one. I tried to block that out, but my mind kept coming back to it. That ruined my birthday a little bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>That weekend I went to a concert for Wave to Earth, where I got my 222 grade in the middle of it: 59.</p>
<p>Tuesday, coming to school, got back 250: 62.</p>
<p>That week, our 240 prof handed out the exams in class: 72.</p>
<p>Next week, 205 got returned: 61.</p>
