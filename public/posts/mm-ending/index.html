  <div class="post-content"><p>I can tell you the exact moment I fell in love with music.</p>
<p>It was April 2019. In my english class, we had a project to make a music video for a song of our choice (mine wasn&rsquo;t very notable). One of my classmates picked <em>Heartless</em> by Kanye West. When I heard that autotuned chorus and deep 808s for the first time, I knew that there was something that I&rsquo;d been missing out on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/mm-ending/tlop-art.jpeg" alt="tlop"  />
</p>
<p>Kanye was the first artist I gravitated to after that. I fell in love with <em>Kids See Ghosts</em> and <em>808s</em>. Despite his recent spiral off the face of the earth, Kanye and his music will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me until years later, Kanye was in the midst of a complicated rollout at the time for his album <em>Yandhi</em>. Although it would never see the light of day, transforming into <em>Jesus Is King</em>, I feel regretful that I was never into music enough to experience these moments; to be able to see the rollout of my favourite albums and watch the creative process unfold in real time.</p>
<p>Then on May 13, 2022, Kendrick Lamar released <em>Mr Morale. &amp; The Big Steppers</em>.</p>

<p>Everything about this album is special. The announcement on his website, the feature run on his cousin&rsquo;s album, announcing the album in reply to a tweet saying he&rsquo;d retired-there&rsquo;s endless sources. But above them all, the music itself reigns above it all.</p>
<p>For a second, let me go back to my grade 8 english class. I&rsquo;ve said that I didn&rsquo;t always like writing or a traditional english curriculum, but I did always appreciate parts of the classes. I always liked the classic narrative conflicts that you learn about in introductory English; man vs. self, man vs. man, man vs. nature, etc. They are simple, but so effective in telling a story and communicating a message. Of course, this depends heavily on execution.</p>
<p>I like to envision Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s albums as embodying these classic conflicts:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em> is man vs. world; Kendrick navigating life in the gang-dominated, violence-stricken world of Compton.</li>
<li><em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em> is man vs. society; Kendrick faces constructs beyond tangibility-systemic racism, the pressures of leadership, etc.</li>
<li><em>DAMN.</em> is man vs. world; Kendrick adapts to a new societal position and seeks to reconcile with his humanity. Although I find it incredibly difficult to pin <em>DAMN.</em> to a single conflict-this might need its own analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kendrick is, arguably, the benchmark of our generation-a transcendentalist. His work has already proven its timeless status in his relatively short studio career. This rapid accession explains why title after title is casted on him; &ldquo;the saviour of hip-hop&rdquo;, &ldquo;the greatest rapper of all time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This brings us to Kendrick&rsquo;s newest studio album.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Morale</em> is about understanding Kendrick Lamar the person. Not Kendrick the artist, the rapper, or, most pivotally, the saviour. It is an album about understanding, hatred, breaking perpetuated cycles and self-forgiveness. But like other albums, I believe it encompasses a classic conflict-perhaps the most important of them.</p>
<p><strong>Man vs. self</strong>. Kendrick turns inwards, facing the internal grief and trauma that has dominated his life up to this point and breaking past it. Society casts Kendrick as a flawless individual; our role model; our <strong>saviour</strong>. In his search for self-forgiveness, he casts himself as the opposite-a flawed man.</p>
<p>There is a well known quote from Nietzsche that may best encompass the thesis of <em>Mr. Morale</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a false saying: &lsquo;How can someone who can&rsquo;t save himself save others?&rsquo; Suppose I have the keys to your chains. Why should your lock and my lock be the same?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion of a story is perhaps the most important aspect. In most narratives, a lacking ending is detrimental to the whole, but a great one is perennial. Think <em>Breaking Bad</em> vs. <em>Game of Thrones</em> for example.</p>
<p>This holds true in music and especially so in the discography of Kendrick. <em>Mortal Man</em> concludes the long poem that narrates <em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em> and resolves the album as a whole through its central influence: Tupac Shakur. <em>DUCKWORTH.</em> tells the story of a chance encounter that ultimately led to Kendrick&rsquo;s career, and splits <em>DAMN.</em> into two entirely separate narratives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of value in a concluding track. In the case of <em>Mr. Morale</em>, there are two that can be examined: <em>Mirror</em> and <em>The Heart Part 5</em>. <em>Mirror</em> was the final track on release, while <em>The Heart Part 5</em> was released as promotional single in <em>The Heart</em> series a week prior, later added as a bonus track.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/mm-ending/count-me-out-still.webp" alt="still"  />
</p>
<h2 id="mirror"><em>Mirror</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mirror">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry I didn&rsquo;t save the world, my friend / I was too busy building mine again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Mirror</em> concludes the second disc of the album as the original closer. Disc 1-<em>The Big Steppers</em>-is an open examination of Kendrick&rsquo;s flaws, while disc 2-<em>Mr. Morale</em>-is Kendrick actualizing the forgiveness he eventually grants himself on <em>Mother I Sober</em>, by &lsquo;freeing&rsquo; himself and the others damaged by trauma. <em>Mirror</em> serves as an affirmation of the ideas of disc 2: the deconstrution of his saviour image, acceptance of flaws, and understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I choose me, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live in the matrix / Rather fall short of your graces&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time to break it off / Run away from the culture to follow my heart&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, <em>Mirror</em> confirms that Kendrick has achieved his breakthrough, forgiving himself for the guilt and trauma he&rsquo;s internalized.</p>
<h2 id="the-heart-part-5"><em>The Heart Part 5</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-heart-part-5">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Heart Part 5</em> is a message from a post-epiphany Kendrick to &rsquo;the culture&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen Kendrick tear himself down to reveal the common truth: all of us are flawed, including himself. Accepting that no one man can be a saviour, Kendrick has gained perspective. <em>The Heart Part 5</em>, at its core, is a beautiful relay of <em>Mr. Morale</em>&rsquo;s core messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over / That&rsquo;s the problem&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sacrifice personal gain over everything / Just to see the next generation better than ours&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Look for salvation when troubles get real / &lsquo;Cause you can&rsquo;t help the world until you help yourself&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The culture is a cycle that can only heal if those part of it can break the pattern. In <em>The Heart Part 5</em>, this framework is laid by Kendrick. Ultimately, he just wants the culture to want him for what he&rsquo;s done for them-an ironically selfish, yet human desire which gracefully concludes the story of Kendrick Lamar.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-better-ending-track">What is the better ending track?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-the-better-ending-track">#</a></h2>
<p>Evidently, both are amazing songs independently and within the scope of the album. <em>Mirror</em> succeeds at what it seeks to do, that is, resolving the narrative of <em>Mr. Morale</em> and affirming the messages. <em>Mirror</em> doesn&rsquo;t need to be multifaceted, in this regard. But as a result, <em>The Heart Part 5</em> is allowed to be a more grandiose and fulfilling ending not only to <em>Mr. Morale</em> but to the story of Kendrick that began with <em>Section.80</em>.</p>
<p>This might seem a bit anti-climatic, but if it wasn&rsquo;t already clear, I think <em>The Heart Part 5</em> is a greater conclusion to <em>Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers</em>. Beyond this, I believe it may even be the best song in Kendrick&rsquo;s discography, and one of the greatest songs in the canon of hip-hop.</p>

<p>This is transformation.</p>
