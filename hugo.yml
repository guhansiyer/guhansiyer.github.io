     - Hi! I'm Guhan, a second year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Recently, I  finished my first co-op term at NCR Voyix as a Systems Software Engineer. 

     -
     
     - I'm primarily interested in firmware development and embedded systems, but I'm trying to learn more about whatever interests me.

     -

     - Outside of tech, I love history, trivia and music. I've always had a deep passion for the humanities and art, and I do my best to enrich it. 

     -

     - Check out the links below if you want to reach me, my resume above if you'd like to know more about my professional background, or the posts if you're interested in my ramblings :)
