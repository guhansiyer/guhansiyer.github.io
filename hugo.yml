     - Hello. I'm a third year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Last fall, I was at Nokia, working on the firmware and SDK for next generation optical transceivers.

     -
     
     - I'm primarily interested in systems programming and operating systems. In the past I've worked with embedded systems and digital design.

     -

     - Outside of engineering, I love history, trivia and music. I've always had a deep passion for the humanities and art, and I do my best to enrich it. 

     -

     - Check out the links below if you want to reach me, my resume above if you'd like to know more about my professional background, or the posts if you're interested in my ramblings.
