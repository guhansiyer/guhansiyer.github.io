     - Hello. I'm a third year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm at Nokia working on the firmware and SDK for next generation optical transceivers.

     -
     
     - I'm primarily interested in systems programming and operating systems. In the past I've worked with embedded systems and digital design.

     -

     - Outside of engineering, I love history, trivia and music. I've always had a deep passion for the humanities and art, and I do my best to enrich it. 

     -
