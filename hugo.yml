     - Hi! I'm Guhan, a first year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm also a firmware developer on the student design team UW Orbital. 

     -
     
     - I'm primarily interested in firmware development and embedded systems, but I'm trying to learn more about whatever interests me. Right now, that's digital hardware and real-time operating systems. 

     -

     - Outside of tech, I'm a history, trivia, and music nerd. I've always had a deep passion for the humanities and do my best to enrich it. 

     -

     - Check out the links below if you want to reach me, my resume above if you'd like to know more about my professional background, or the posts if you're interested in my ramblings :)
