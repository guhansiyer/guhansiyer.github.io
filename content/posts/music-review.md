> *MUSIC* has finally escaped development hell, but it's hard to tell where exactly the last 4 years have gone to: 4.3/10

Let me be apparent: I thought the day that I could open Spotify and see a new album from Playboi Carti was still far away, if not never coming. I was convinced *MUSIC* became one of the great mythologies in hip-hop, like *Detox*, *Yandhi*, or anything from Frank Ocean.

If you're unfamilar with Carti and his antics, let's go over how we got here.

In September 2021, Carti failed to drop his planned 3rd album *Narcissist* In April 2022, an interview with XXL revealed that Carti's new album was now *MUSIC*. The rest of 2022 was relatively silent, aside from a pump-fake to close off the year. Akin to the development of *Whole Lotta Red*, *MUSIC* now spanned many creative versions. The one we're the most familiar with emerged in mid 2023, with Carti's feature on Travis Scott's *FEIN* displaying his new deep voice style. 

Later in December, the "final" rollout began with the release of the singles *DIFFERENT DAY* and *2024*, which were followed in the new year by *H00DBYAIR*, *KETAMINE*, *EVIL J0RDAN* and *BACKR00MS*. The rollout was then paused as Carti featured on projects such as *VULTURES 1* and *WE DON'T TRUST YOU*. As the year went on, there was no sign of a concrete release. We were given the singles *ALL RED* and *PLAY THIS*, both of which didn't make the final tracklist, and the latter wasn't even dropped on DSPs along with any of the prior mentioned singles. Possible date after possible date passed by, until we were into the new year.

But then it all happened so fast. In one week we had a release date and classic Carti antics: fit pics, incessant Instagram stories, and an unfathomable rebuild of hype. It was almost unbecoming after all that happened over the last 3 years. Somethings never change though, and he was late to the Friday release date by seven hours. Regardless, I woke up on March 14th to see a new Playboi Carti album.
