> *MUSIC* has finally escaped development hell, but it's hard to tell where exactly the last 4 years have gone to: 4.3/10

Let me be clear: I thought the day that I could open Spotify and see a new album from Playboi Carti was still far away, if not never coming. I was convinced *MUSIC* became one of the great mythologies in hip-hop, like *Detox*, *Yandhi*, or anything from Frank Ocean.

If you're unfamilar with Carti and his antics, let's go over how we got here.

In September 2021, Carti failed to drop his planned 3rd album *Narcissist*. The next April, an interview with XXL revealed that Carti's new album was now *MUSIC*. The rest of 2022 was relatively silent, aside from a pump-fake to close off the year. Much later in December 2023, the "final" rollout began with the release of the singles *DIFFERENT DAY* and *2024*, which were followed in the new year by *H00DBYAIR*, *KETAMINE*, *EVIL J0RDAN* and *BACKR00MS*. The rollout was then paused as Carti featured on projects such as *VULTURES 1* and *WE DON'T TRUST YOU*. As the year went on, there was no sign of a concrete release. We were given the singles *ALL RED* and *PLAY THIS*, both of which didn't make the final tracklist, and the latter wasn't even dropped on DSPs along with any of the prior mentioned singles. Possible date after possible date passed by, until we were into the new year.

But then it all happened so fast. In one week we had a release date and classic Carti antics: fit pics, incessant Instagram stories, and an unfathomable rebuild of hype. It was almost unbecoming after all that happened over the last 3 years. But as much as things change, they also stay the same, and he was late to the Friday release date by seven hours. Regardless, I woke up on March 14th to see a new Playboi Carti album.

*MUSIC* is a difficult album-difficult in many contexts. It's a massive mesh of everything that makes up Carti. The tracklist is a blitz of beats from noted collaborators, including F1lthy, Cardo and Ojivolta. There's elements of Kanye's grandiosity, classic Future-style toxicity and moral corruptness, and of course, the ever-prescence of Lil Wayne. The Wayne tributes are strong on *MUSIC*, most evidently in the working title of *I AM MUSIC*, but also in the album format. The presentation is much more akin to a *Wayne* style mixtape than that of a standard LP, all complete with the narration of DJ Swamp Izzo.

This execution doesn't come flawless, however. E
