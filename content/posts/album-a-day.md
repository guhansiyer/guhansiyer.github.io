I missed the first two months of the year, but better late than never.

If the other posts haven't made it clear, I really love music. I guess from that it follows that I always want to listen to more music. To make an effort in accomplishing this, I've decided that from today (Friday, March 13), onwards until New Years Eve, I'll be listening to a new album every day. 

I'll use this post to track what I listen to each month and give a review of what I deem to be the best album I listen to in each month; encompassing new and old music. I'll also be placing all of these albums on [my list](https://guhaniyer.com/posts/album-list/), so hopefully that will be more fleshed out by the year's end.

Enjoy the scroll!
