6 hours ago, I wrote my final exam of my 2A term.

The 2A term has always felt like the Department of ECE decided to limit test its students. Engineering, and ECE in general, has always been a meme for having some of the worst schedules that a person could devise (see the 1B schedule below), but there was just something about the 2A structure that was so uniquely soul crushing.

*The big green wall.*

For as bad as that schedule *looks*, in actuality it isn't terrible, because this is still first year. The only real concern is having to be conscious enough in the morning to go do your labs.

In 2A, the schedule *looks* a lot nicer. But you still have 6 courses, five of which are full credit, and 3 of which have labs:

* [ECE109](https://uwflow.com/course/ece109): Materials Chemistry
* [ECE204](https://uwflow.com/course/ece204): Numerical Methods
* [ECE205](https://uwflow.com/course/ece205): Advanced Calculus 1 (Differential Equations)
* [ECE222](https://uwflow.com/course/ece222): Digital Computers
* [ECE240](https://uwflow.com/course/ece240): Electronic Circuits
* [ECE250](https://uwflow.com/course/ece250): Algorithms & Data Structures

How'd it go? Well...

## September

2A started rather unceremoniously. At the end of my previous term, I arranged a research assistantship with a friend of mine, which would've been about developing a Verilog synthesizer in Scala. But as 1B came to a close, I fell quite short of the requirements for the URA and fell out of eligibility. This was entirely my fault; the sum of a lot of preventable mistakes, but it was a very sour note to begin the term on.

As school started, so did the co-op search. I was looking to get into embedded software and systems programming this time around. My first co-op was as a systems engineer where I developed internal tools for the company's R&D sector. When I was searching for my first co-op, I interviewed for two firmware positions and got an offer for one of them, but for certain reasons decided not to accept it.

September came and went; the first co-op cycle was relatively uneventful aside from a very weird interview where my interviewer left the call for 10 out of 30 minutes. School was beginning to speed up and I was... very neglectful of it.

## October

October is when the gravity of my procrastination really started to weigh on me. To begin, I couldn't convert that interview into an offer (although I'm still not sure how much that's my fault), putting me in cycle 2. The month was characterized by a cycle:

1. Have a task ahead.
2. Feel confident about finishing it in a short time.
3. Start the task, overrun my estimated time by 2x on the simplest part.
4. Start tweaking until something clicks.

On a serious note, it was during one of my 250 projects when I felt that something was off with me. It was the combination of a bunch of factors weighing on me all at once. 

I thought I'd be able to get an early co-op and not have to go through the hell that is job searching during hell week. I thought I'd be able to do a lot better with school than I did last term. I thought that I would be doing interesting research. I thought I would be a better person than I was last term.

But to all of these, I was wrong. I felt, ultimately that I had let a lot of people down; primarily myself.

Outside of academic life there was even more weighing down. Over my co-op term I was diagnosed with a chronic, possibly autoimmune skin disease that I had been dealing with for a year at that point. It's characterized by inflammed, scaly and flaky skin almost like psoriasis. At the point where I was during October, I felt like trying to treat it was futile. The pain resulting from it only increased day by day, but I had exhausted all treatment options by that point. I didn't like being dependent on medication even if they weren't addictive; it just felt like false hope to me since I knew that it would come back. Between my family doctor, dermatologist, and any sources I could get my hands on that were the slightest bit helpful, one statement was repeated by all of them: "this is lifelong." It just seemed so bizzare that one day a switch flipped and suddenly my skin is trying to kill itself. I started to wonder if at this point, everything was beyond repair. So I stopped everything. Anything that had even an ounce of medication in it, I wouldn't use it.

All of these combined into a period of severe depression, as I was entering the most stressful time of the semester. Studying for my five back-to-back midterms was, to say the least, difficult. My primary concern was ECE240; like all my classes at that point, I was not very caught up and trying desperately to do so before the midterm. Historically, 240 had some awful exams; so difficult you wonder who was meant to solve them. But this was a new professor and I had no idea if that was still the case. So, I blindly invested most of my time into this exam, as I felt reasonably better about my other courses.

Exam week rolls around. I'll give you the day-by-day:

* Monday (240): Class consensus is that it was extremely easy (to be fair it was just like the homework we practiced with). In hindsight, it was definitely a really easy exam, but in the moment I felt like I got a 20. I spent the rest of the day trying to block it out of my mind and study for my next midterm. When I got home I had a breakdown over the exam.
* Tuesday (222): VERY long but I felt way better about how I did. Spent the majority of that day studying for my **next** midterm since 222 was at night.
* Wednesday (204): Pretty standard but I could've studied more.
* Thursday (250): I did a lot of prep and I felt prepared for the entire exam, save this one design question. Felt like this was going to be my best midterm.
* Friday (205): This was my birthday (October 25). I felt like it went similar to 204; fine but I should've studied more. In the afternoon I went rock climbing with some friends and got back our 204 grade in the middle of that. My result? 45. I was a little adamant that there had to be a mistake, but felt deep down that there wasn't one. I tried to block that out, but my mind kept coming back to it. That ruined my birthday a little bit.

That weekend I went to a concert for Wave to Earth, where I got my 222 grade in the middle of it: 59.

Tuesday, coming to school, got back 250: 62.

That week, our 240 prof handed out the exams in class: 72.

Next week, 205 got returned: 61.
