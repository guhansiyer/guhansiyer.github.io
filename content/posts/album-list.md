This post has all of the albums I've listened to, or plan to listen to. I rate things on a 10-point scale, which I describde throughout the list. I also list off my top 3 tracks on these albums, and any notable themes/ideas I pick up from my listens. At the end is a list of all the albums I plan to listen to, which you can find [here](#unlistened).

I used to host this list in my iPhone notes app, where I had a 100-point scale. The problem was that I was really inconsistent and my average for albums was in the mid-80s, which I think is way too liberal. I thought the Fantano model was nice to base this scale off of, so here's some clarifications:
* Fantano rates things on a 10-point scale, where any score from 1 to 9 can be further described as light, decent, or strong. Ultimately, he gives a range of two scores to an album (unless they're a definitive 0 or 10), and one becomes the ultimate rating for an album.
    * For example, when Fantano reviewed *Kids See Ghosts*, he gave it a "strong 9 to a 10", ultimately rating it a 10.
    * I think this is a bit too complex, so I'll stick to one score.
* **Q: How should I map a Fantano 7 into my system?**
* **A:**
    * Light 7: 7.0-7.3
    * Decent 7: 7.4-7.6
    * Strong 7: 7.7-7.9
* A 10 is the peak of the scale, but within my 10s is a structure that's a matter of favour; it'll be reflected in the order.

## 10: BENCHMARKS
These albums are the pinnacle. They are the standard to which I compare other media. They show little to no flaws in their art in all aspects (song selection, lyrics, production, themes/stories, structure, etc.)

## 7: GOOD
A definitively good album, that is great in all aspects as previously described. However, several factors hold these albums back from surpassing this status, such as occasionally lacking production, often unsubstantial lyrics, etc.

* [*UTOPIA*: Travis Scott](https://open.spotify.com/album/18NOKLkZETa4sWwLMIm0UZ?si=8003aef7627645ca) (7.0)

    * Core idea(s): The pursuit of perfection.

## 6: SATISFACTORY
These albums are middling. They may be great in some aspects but quite lacking in others, thus holding them back from being considered definitively 'good'.

* [*Because The Internet*: Childish Gambino](https://open.spotify.com/album/62yjWIhnATHxPqGbgC9Lqr?si=qw3zGr-dR6CYyQdZczfSPg) (6.7)
    * Top 3: 3005, Telegraph Ave.("Oakland" by Lloyd), Flight of the Navigator

## 5: AVERAGE
By all measures, these albums are simply average. They aren't terrible at what they seek out to do, but aren't very good at it either.

## 4: MEDIOCRE
Falling just below the bar, these albums have more flaws than upsides; flaws that are present enough to weight down these albums in their artistic pursuits.

## 3: BAD
This is the point in the scale where the flaws in an album become more damning than those with a greater score. Often, this is shown through severly deficient aspects, but there are still some redeemable factors to hold these albums up.

## 2: AWFUL
The upsides are few and far in between. Outside of them, these albums have glaring flaws in most if not all aspects.

## 1: TERRIBLE
These albums are almost completely unremarkable. What holds them back from being any worse is a single or few redeemable qualities.

## 0: APPALLING
There is nothing to be found. No trace of artistry or even an attempt at it. This is the lowest point in media.
