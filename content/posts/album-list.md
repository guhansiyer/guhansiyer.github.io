This post has all of the albums I've listened to, or plan to listen to. I rate things on a 10-point scale, which I describde throughout the list. I also list off my top 3 tracks on these albums, and any notable themes/ideas I pick up from my listens. At the end is a list of all the albums I plan to listen to, which you can find [here](#unlistened).

## 10: BENCHMARKS
These albums are the pinnacle. They are the standard to which I compare other media. They show little to no flaws in their art in all aspects (song selection, lyrics, production, themes/stories, structure, etc.)

## 6: SATISFACTORY
These albums are middling. They may be great in some aspects but quite lacking in others, thus holding them back from being considered definitively 'good'.

    * Top 3: 3005, Telegraph Ave.("Oakland" by Lloyd), Flight of the Navigator

## 5: AVERAGE
By all measures, these albums are simply average. They aren't terrible at what they seek out to do, but aren't very good at it either.

## 4: MEDIOCRE
Falling just below the bar, these albums have more flaws than upsides; flaws that are present enough to weight down these albums in their artistic pursuits.

* [*MUSIC*: Playboi Carti](https://open.spotify.com/album/0fSfkmx0tdPqFYkJuNX74a?si=u72gXwLwTWm4plsmwfsvVg) (4.5)
    * Top 3: POP OUT, BACKD00R, I SEEEEEE YOU BABY BOI

* [*VULTURES 1*: ¥$](https://open.spotify.com/album/4DOsPwJtokv6HEifZ6t5j6?si=oJhxoNJER6K-lRdP0sSiYA) (4.2)
    * Top 3: BURN, DO IT, TALKING

## 3: BAD
This is the point in the scale where the flaws in an album become more damning than those with a greater score. Often, this is shown through severly deficient aspects, but there are still some redeemable factors to hold these albums up.

* [*VULTURES 2*: ¥$](https://open.spotify.com/album/5RV2TNyjylqWJNxQyHBTeJ?si=JSyqtut-Rk-X0RV3qAp-EA) (3.6)
    * Top 3: RIVER, SLIDE, PROMOTION

## 2: AWFUL
The upsides are few and far in between. Outside of them, these albums have glaring flaws in most if not all aspects.

## 1: TERRIBLE
These albums are almost completely unremarkable. What holds them back from being any worse is a single or few redeemable qualities.

## 0: APPALLING
There is nothing to be found. No trace of artistry or even an attempt at it. This is the lowest point in media.
